# Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this challenge we were tasked with using the  [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. WE used this third-party API to access their data by making requests with specific parameters to the URL. We build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

## Installation

Open the link in my GitHub Repo!

## Usage
- WHEN someone searchs for a city 
- THEN they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN someone views current weather conditions for that city
- THEN they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN someone views future weather conditions for that city
- THEN they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN someone clicks on a city in the search history
- THEN they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
